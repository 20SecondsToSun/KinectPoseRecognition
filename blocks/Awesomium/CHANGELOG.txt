                     a previously created WebSession with the same DataPath, 
                     instead of attempting to create a new one.
        - [Modified] Made it so the IsManipulationEnabled of WPF presenters is 
                     bound to the WebControl (this will propagate the

                    through WebSessionProviders).

                    (see WebPopupMenu and WebPopupMenuBase).
        - [Feature] Added default WPF certificate error dialog.
        - [Feature] Added default WPF web page info cpntrol and popup.
